		where $x_1$  is initial state of neuron, fired by the constant input $u_0$, $x_1$, $x_2$, $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ are state variables, dot represents time derivative.  When firing reaches some threshold, the neuron goes to state $\nu_1$ through eq. (\ref{eq:CPG2}). When it exceeds some threshold it starts to return to the state $x_1$ through the eq. (\ref{eq:CPG1}) by the factor $\beta$. $\beta$ represents the rate of adaptations, if $\beta$ is big, the return to state $x_1$ is fast. $u_{f_1}$ and $u_{f_2}$ are the feedback inputs from sensors, $\gamma$ is the coefficient between state variables and f(x) is a threshold function that has zero gain until x is less than threshold value and not zero gain otherwise . Such element works the following way: when it takes constant input it reacts, then adapts and stop reacting. Oscillations generation is the process of reaction and adaptation itself.

		where $a_{ij}$ represents the strength of inhibitory connection between the neurons. $a_{ij} >$ 0 for i$\neq$j and $a_{ij}$ = 0 for i = j. $\sum^n_{j = 1} a_{ij} y_j $ is the total input from the neurons inside a neural network and $s_{i}$ is the total input from the outside of the network, $y_j$ is input from neuron j.
