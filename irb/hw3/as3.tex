\textbf{Part 1}	

\bigskip
	
\textbf{Exercise 1}		
		
\textbf{Solution}

\medskip

\newcounter{bcounter}

According to [1], Manocha and Zhu (1994) proposed a generalized closed form solution which can be derived for 6 DOF (or less) kinematic chain.

\begin{list}{(\alph{bcounter})~}{\usecounter{bcounter}}
\item False. It is possible that the target for EE is unreachable.
\item False. It is possible that the target for EE is unreachable.
\item False. It is possible that the target for EE is unreachable.
\item True.
\end{list}

\textbf{Exercise 2}		
		
\textbf{Solution}

\medskip

\begin{list}{(\alph{bcounter})~}{\usecounter{bcounter}}
\item False. 3 DoF manipulator with rotation joints can have only 2 dimension work-space
\item False. Dextrous can be empty.
\item True. E.g. 1 DoF manipulator with 2 dimension work-space and rotation joint with different length of links.
\item False.
\end{list}

\textbf{Exercise 3}		
		
\textbf{Solution}

\medskip

\begin{list}{(\alph{bcounter})~}{\usecounter{bcounter}}
\item True.
\item False. Usually we go from trigonometric to transcendental equations.
\item True. We user FK during solving IK.
\item True. IK problem needs a very fast computational engine in order to make solution in real-time.
\end{list}

\textbf{Exercise 4}		
		
\textbf{Solution}

\medskip

\begin{list}{(\alph{bcounter})~}{\usecounter{bcounter}}
\item False. We have considered the case of revolute joints.
\item False. Links are not important in IK it can only affect the work-space.
\item False. It is solution for manipulators with 6DOF’s when three consecutive axis intersect.
\item False.
\end{list}
